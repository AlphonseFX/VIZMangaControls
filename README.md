# Hotkeys for VIZ Manga

Tired of the standard control options for the VIZ manga reader? This extension provides additional hotkeys/control functionality, to supplement your reading experience. As of the current release, your options are:  
- Fullscreen (F)
- Single column mode (S)
- Previous/next chapter (Q/E)
- Next/previous page (A/D)
- Scroll wheel page selection (UP = previous, DOWN = next)

Additionally, it automatically pops out the reader in single column mode, and will redirect you to the next chapter automatically when you reach the final page. 

You can find a packed extension on the Chrome Web Store here (old version, pending update to 0.0.3):
