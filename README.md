# Hotkeys for VIZ Manga

Tired of the standard control options for the VIZ manga reader? This extension provides additional hotkeys/control functionality, to supplement your reading experience. As of the current release, your options are:  
- Fullscreen (F)
- Single column mode (S)
- Previous/next chapter (Q/E)
- Next/previous page (A/D)
- Scroll wheel page selection (UP = previous, DOWN = next)

Additionally, it automatically pops out the reader in single column mode, and will redirect you to the next chapter automatically when you reach the final page. 

Note that while similar, the packed extension below offers more features than this userscript:
